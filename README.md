# 🛒 QuickBill – Smart Grocery Billing App
## 📌 Overview

**EaseBill** is a web-based application designed for grocery store owners to streamline their billing process. It allows shopkeepers to scan product barcodes one by one to automatically generate a receipt and QR code. Customers can simply scan the QR code to access their digital receipt.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Database Setup**:  
   The store owner must first add all product items to the system database.

2. **Billing Process**:  
   During checkout, the shopkeeper scans items individually using their barcodes. The app automatically creates a receipt based on the scanned items.

3. **Customer Receipt Access**:  
   A QR code is generated for the customer, which when scanned, provides a viewable digital receipt.
